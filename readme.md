# Final Website
## Overview
For this site I want to create a portfolio that showcased my work in different media.  I want to create four pages: a home page, a photography page, a parkour page, and a contact page.  I want each page to demonstrate some of my proudest work in each area.  Aesthetically I want this site to follow a somewhat minimalist style, that is clean, consistent, and responsive. The color pallet that I will use is a combination of grey scale and a variety of blues.

## Home Page
The home page on this site is very simple. It features a hero image that I captured a year ago in Honolulu, and a nav-bar that leads to my other pages.

## Photo Page
This page is meant to showcase some of my work in photography. I divided my work into three categories: landscape, portrait, and action. I wanted to create a gallery for each section, but the only examples that I could find online involved using JavaScript, which I am not familiar with. Although it is a very limited selection, I chose three photos that I felt were a good representation of my work in each category. The hero image on this page is another photo from my trip to Honolulu.

## Parkour/Video Page
This page is meant to showcase some of the video work that I've done, as well as some of my movement as a parkour practitioner. I had a decent amount of trouble with this page, as I wanted to use iframes to show my videos. I was unable to make the iframe attribute function properly for YouTube videos unfortunately. I decided to leave the frames on the page to demonstrate what I was planning for the page, but I have also included links so that the videos are still accessible through the page. The hero image on this page is a photo of my friend Sam Wood in Tampa Florida, doing a stride.

## Contact Page
For this page I chose not to include a hero image, instead using a simple background color. I kept this page simple, only including a link to email me, and a link to my Instagram account, as those are the two best methods of getting in contact with me.
