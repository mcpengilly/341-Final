# Final Website
## Overview
For this site I want to create a portfolio that showcased my work in different media.  I want to create four pages: a home page, a photography page, a parkour page, and a contact page.  I want each page to demonstrate some of my proudest work in each area.  Aesthetically I want this site to follow a somewhat minimalist style, that is clean, consistent, and responsive. The color pallet that I will use is a combination of grey scale and a variety of blues.
